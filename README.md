# powershell-pock-paper-scissors-GUI

This is a small project I used to teach myself the syntax of Windows PowerShell.
It is a functional Rock Paper Scissors GUI where you play aginst a CPU that chooses
a random choice. This program should work except for the file paths for the images
and the images themselves will have to be changed unique to your computer.
